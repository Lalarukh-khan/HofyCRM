                <h4 class="cnf_settxt">Are you managing remote working effectively?
                    <br><br>
                    (It can be quick and easy.)
                    <br><br>
                    Remote working is set to stay, even if just once a week. That means you’ll need systems and processes 
                    to ensure remote working runs smoothly. You’ll want to deliver brilliant experiences for your employees, 
                    stay compliant, and make sure your initiatives are as quick, easy and efficient as possible.
                    <br><br>
                    All that is easier said than done. But it’s important your business gets it right.
                    <br><br>
                    Here’s what it takes to effectively manage remote working, and a quick, easy way to take it off your to-do-list.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Remote working isn’t just ‘what’. It’s ‘who’ and ‘how’.
                    <br><br>
                    Right now, many companies are rushing to stand up new, in-house teams to tackle the complex challenge of remote 
                    working. Bringing together people, skills and knowledge from across HR Ops, Facilities & IT, Legal and Finance,
                     these new teams have their work cut out for them.
                     <br><br>
                     If you opt for the in-house route, know that it’ll be complex and time intensive. Research shows that 
                     internal teams spend <b style="font-weight: 500">30 minutes to 4 hours per employee per year,</b> working to ensure they’re set up for remote 
                     working. Often, this isn’t an efficient approach. Especially at scale.
                     <br><br>
                     On top of that, it can take an internal team a long time to get up and running, with plenty of hurdles along the way. 
                     We’ve seen <b style="font-weight: 500">an average of 8-16 weeks of planning and preparation before the first 
                     home office delivery.</b> Meanwhile, are your employees perched on the edge of a sofa, leaning over a laptop with a 
                     slow internet connection? Speed is just as important as ease.
                    <br><br>
                    Here are some questions to think about:
                    <br><br>
                    Are you managing remote working with an internal team? <br>
                    Is that internal team as efficient as possible? <br>
                    Have you gathered diverse employee requirements? <br>
                    Do you know how to identify safe, complaint equipment and assemble it safely? <br>
                    Do you understand the regulations that apply specifically to working in a domestic environment?  <br>
                    Do you have access to the best value suppliers? <br>
                    Can you command the best prices from your suppliers? <br>
                    What’s your deployment timeline? <br>
                    Do you have a smart, easy system for arranging deliveries, anywhere? <br>
                    Are you carrying out up-to-date DSE assessments specifically designed for home offices? <br>
                    Do you have relationships with ergonomists offering a complete virtual service? <br>
                    Do you have an effortless system for managing new ad-hoc requests? <br>
                    Are you tracking your assets, so you have an up-to-date inventory?  <br>
                    Are you tracking asset values for tax purposes? <br>
                    Do you have a process for recovering equipment when an employee leaves? <br>
                    Do you understand how to stay tax compliant? 
                    <br><br><br>
                    Get ship shape. So your teams can get to work.
                    <br><br>
                    While standing up an in-house team to tackle the challenge of remote working is tricky enough, it’s important 
                    to remember that you’re here to serve your teams and employees. An in-house home working management team needs 
                    to be efficient in and of itself, but it also exists – first and foremost – to empower the many other teams in your
                    business.
                    <br><br>
                    If you’re succeeding, employees will have fast, easy access to safe, compliant high-quality equipment. 
                    They’ll be able to do their job happily and productively, without niggles and blockers. And they’ll be able to 
                    communicate with clarity, thanks to fast internet, high resolution web-cams and more. All this, and more, will 
                    rest with you.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Or, let Hofy sort it.
                    <br><br>
                    There’s an alternative to standing up an internal team to mastermind remote working. It’s Hofy.
                    <br><br>
                    We sort home offices for businesses in just a couple of clicks, making remote working quick and easy. We 
                    mastermind every step, from selection and delivery to repairs and recovery – at scale.
                    <br><br>
                    Here’s a glimpse at how we do it:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We’ve created a next generation management platform to view employees, track equipment and handle requests,
                             all in one place</li>
                        <li>We’ve built strong relationships with forward-thinking manufacturers and suppliers</li>
                        <li>We’ve cut equipment lead times from 8-12 weeks to 1-2 weeks</li>
                        <li>We’ve negotiated the best prices</li>
                        <li>Our 72-hour on-site warranty replacements save valuable working hours</li>
                        <li>Our software integrates with your HR platforms, so you can automate new starter onboarding and leaver
                             offboarding</li>
                        <li>We’ve introduced a monthly subscription model, turning home offices into an affordable monthly expense, 
                            rather than a large outlay</li>
                        <li>Because Hofy home offices can be rented, not only is there no tax to pay – tax reporting is taken 
                            off your agenda</li>
                        <li>And much more</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    In a nutshell? Our out-of-the-box home offices are fully managed and compliant, saving you time and hassle, 
                    and bringing you peace of mind. Hofy is 10x cheaper than using a traditional office and much quicker, easier and 
                    cheaper than relying on an internal team to take care of everything.
