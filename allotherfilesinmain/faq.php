            We also offer H&S workstation assessments in-platform, which meet or exceed UK and EU Directive requirements

        <button class="faq_accordion">How does Hofy help with tax compliance?</button>
        <div class="faq_panel">
        <p>Renting equipment through Hofy avoids the tax implications of gifting equipment to employees.  <br><br>
        That’s because, if you gift equipment - either upon purchase or when an employee leaves your organisation - you may need to 
        report it on the employee’s payroll and tax return that a gift of a certain value was given to the employee. Your employee may 
        then face income tax and national insurance charges on the value of the equipment. <br><br>
        If you rent, Hofy owns the equipment for the duration of the rental and collects the equipment at the end of the contract. 
        No payroll reporting duties. No tax risk.</p>

      <div class="faq_ques">
        <button class="faq_accordion">What are the advantages of renting equipment for remote workers, instead of purchasing?</button>
        <div class="faq_panel">
        <p>Renting avoids the financial administration and risk that comes with purchasing equipment outright. <br><br>
        If you purchase equipment for remote workers, you first need to decide whether your business will own it, or whether it 
        will be gifted to the employee.  <br><br>
        If you (the business) owns the equipment, you are responsible for tracking it on financial statements, maintaining and 
        insuring it. You may also be liable for any accidents arising from the assembly or use of the equipment.  <br><br>
        If you gift the equipment to your employee, the tax authority may treat it as a cash gift to the employee. So you may need 
        to track it on your payroll reporting, and there may be tax or national insurance charges on the equipment. <br><br> 
        Rental avoids all of these issues. Rental of equipment used exclusively for work can be treated as a business expense.
         You don’t have to report it in your financial statements, or in the employee's payroll. Hofy owns the equipment for the 
         duration of the rental, so we're responsible for maintaining the equipment. This is why we offer a 10-business-day onsite 
         repair or replacement promise.</p>

      <div class="faq_ques">
        <button class="faq_accordion">How does Hofy’s Rent to Own policy work?</button>
        <div class="faq_panel">
        <p>Hofy’s Rent to Own policy gives you the best of both worlds: rent, with the option to purchase and own items you wish to keep 
            at the end of the minimum term. <br><br>
            That way, you can benefit from the convenience of a rental when the equipment is new and worth a lot, and the longevity of 
            a purchase once the equipment has depreciated. This eliminates the financial reporting and tax implications of purchasing new.<br><br>
            Simply pay a small Option to Purchase fee, and the equipment is yours to keep.</p>

        You can set your rental term to between 6 and 36 months.</p>

      <div class="faq_ques">
        <button class="faq_accordion">What happens at the end of my rental term?</button>
        <div class="faq_panel">
        <p>You can extend your rental for as long as you need the equipment. Once it is no longer needed, we will recover all items. <br><br>
        Under Hofy’s Rent to Own policy, you can also purchase any equipment your team members wish to keep for a small fee.</p>

        <button class="faq_accordion">What if a team member leaves before the end of the minimum contract term?</button>
        <div class="faq_panel">
        <p>You can transfer a rental to another team member who may need the equipment.  <br><br>
        If the equipment is no longer needed, and is in good condition, you may qualify for >20% discount on the remaining rental 
        agreement balance (subject to our Terms of Use).</p>

        <div class="faq_panel">
        <p>Yes. You are required to pay 6 months upfront on 6 and 12 month contracts, and 12 months upfront on 24 and 36 month contracts. 
            You’ll then pay nothing until month 7, or month 13 respectively.</p>
